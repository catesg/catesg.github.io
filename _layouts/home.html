                                <p>
                                    Positive communication practices promote well-being and emotional intelligence within individuals, teams and organisations. By understanding and improving the way we communicate, we can strengthen relationships, reduce
                                    misunderstandings, and become clearer about what we want. We make our interactions and our relationships with others truly count; in both our professional and personal lives.

                                    Student well-being is an important part of developing socially conscious and globally-minded individuals ready to take their place in the wider world. Well-being and mental health underpin academic
                                    achievement and prepares our young people to lead rich, purposeful lives.<br />
                                    Learning to communicate well allows young people to understand others and express themselves as they move towards their goals.

                                    Positive communication and education practices enhance teamwork and productivity. Emotionally intelligent organisations that communicate well are more productive, dynamic and happier places to work. It can attract great candidates and reduce staff turnover. Help your organisation

                            <p class="lead">
                                Communication is one of the most important life skills, yet many of us do not get the best out of our interactions communicate, whether speaking, questioning, or listening. This can lead to untapped potential
                                and missed opportunities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’m Cate Stewart-Gifford, a teacher, trainer and communication professional with over 25 years of experience in communication roles. As a qualified teacher I have trained and taught students at both
                                elementary and secondary level and am a certified Vocational Trainer of Adult Learners (EQF) with the Human Resources Development Authority here in Cyprus.

                                communication. <br />
                                <br />

                                <h5>What is Positive Communication?</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Positive Communication is an approach to communication that helps us understand, deepen, and strengthen the ways in which we communicate. It increases the value that communication brings to our sense of
                                    self, our relationships, the way we work, and the way we live.
