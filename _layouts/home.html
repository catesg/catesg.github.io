      <h2>Why Positive Communication</h2>
      <p class="sub-heading">Positive communication practices promote well-being within individuals, teams and organisations. By understanding the way we and others communicate and becoming better at doing it, we can strengthen relationships across our lives. We reduce misunderstandings, be clear about what we want, stop wasting time and make our interactions with others truly count.</p>
      <h3>Schools & Learning Institutions</h3>
      <p class="sub-heading">Student well-being is an important part of developing socially conscious and globally minded individuals ready to take their place in the wider world. Well-being and mental health underpin academic achievement and prepares our young people to lead rich, purposeful lives.</p>
      <h3>Teams & Organisations</h3>
      <p class="sub-heading">For adult learners and organisations, positive communication and education practices enhance teamwork and productivity. It can attract great candidates, reduce staff turnover and help your organisation stand out as a place people want to do business in, and business with.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p class="sub-heading">Positive Classroom Communication is communication within the classroom that stimulates engagement, creates a constructive learning environment, and promotes student wellbeing. Barriers to PPC arise for a range of reasons; personal communication styles, the environment in which teachers work, or perhaps a general lack of knowledge around communication and the role it plays in the classroom. My current research aims to acquire a 'snapshot' of classroom communication in a private secondary school to determine what barriers exist to PCC, what understandng there is around communication in the classroom, and teachers' perceptions of their interactions. </p>
      <p class="sub-heading">A lot of communication training seems to be focused on two areas - business communication and relationship counselling. It is not so much for the person on the street, which seems a shame, as we are all communicating, whether we mean to or not! Psychologist and philosopher Paul Watzlawick's first axiom says, "One cannot not communicate." Communication is in everything we do, as much as breathing. It is the glue within, or conduit of, our relationships - personal and professional. Isn't it sensical that to strengthen relationships we should strengthen our communication? Shouldn't we all be more conscious of the myriad of messages we send and receive every day?</p>
      <p class="sub-heading">Currently in the pipeline is a series of Instagram reels to feature on <a href="https://instagram.com/communicationbreakdown" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#cdb599;" target="_blank">@communicationbreakdown</a> which will give bitesize information on communication concepts and ideas and how they may be useful to you. I'll update you when this is good to go!</p>
