When we talk about ‘communication noise’, we are not speaking only of sound. Communication Noise creates barriers that affect our communication. It impacts how we perceive and are perceived. By being aware of the different types of noise that influence how we communicate, we can take steps to reduce it.

This is an introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the term. In later posts I will go into more detail about how we can deal with these different types of noise.

In the simplest terms, communication is information being passed between a sender and a receiver, so these are the terms I will use here.

Let’s look at some types of noise we may encounter in our lives.

**Semantic Noise**

A good example of semantic noise is during communication between interactants who have different first languages. Grammar or pronunciation may hinder the meaning of a message. However, listen for the overall message, ask for clarification, and practice patience. Incorrect tense or syntax should be overlooked without judgment; instead look for the meaning and intent. 

(We need to be mindful that for many people speaking in a second or additional language there may be an element of fear, this itself is a type of noise – psychological noise).

Another example of semantic noise is the use of technical language, jargon or idioms. Even when communicating with people who share the same first language, the use of certain words or phrases can cloud, rather than clarify meaning. 

In the case of technical language, this is sometimes necessary in a particular workplace or field, however we should not assume that the receiver of our message understands jargon, acronyms or local phrases. Speak more plainly or be prepared to clarify.  Language is rich and wonderful, and we should embrace a wide vocabulary and allow expression, so don’t be afraid of that. Be colourful but be clear.


**Physiological Noise**

Physiological noise originates from within either the sender or the receiver, and relates to our physiological abilities. This may include a speaking or listening impairment, or a specific learning need. 

As senders, if we are aware of any physiological factors, then we can choose words or a means of communication that will make our message more accessible to the receiver. Similarly, if we are receivers, we can develop awareness of physiological factors. 

Educators frequently see this in the classroom. Children who have difficulty with attention will require their instruction delivered in a way that accommodates physiological needs.


**Physical/Environmental Noise**

I’ve lumped in physical and environmental noise together because there are many similarities. This is noise that originates outside of the sender and receiver.

Have you ever been in a noisy restaurant and not been able to have a conversation with a friend?

What about trying to focus when talking on the phone but being distracted by your children doing something risky in the background, so interrupting your conversation to tell them “do not pour water on the cat”? 

Flashing lights or sirens either drowning you out or catching your attention? Construction happening next door? Other classes yelling in the corridors outside your classroom, or co-workers having a loud conversation when you are trying to concentrate on an important email? This is all physical and/or environmental noise. We can overcome this in a variety of ways. Ask music or conversation volume to be lowered, (or leave!) Make the phone call at a different time or in a different place.

If the sender or receiver are being distracted by the environment, then the effectiveness of the message may be impaired.

**Psychological Noise**

Psychological noise comes from the psychological states of the sender and the receiver. It can include prejudices and stereotypes; it can be an emotional state. Earlier I mentioned the fear some experience when speaking in an additional language. This fear can make us go blank or stop us from attempting to speak in another language altogether.

Past interactions, or even spilling our coffee down the front of our jacket on the way to work, can influence our mental state and spill into our communication. We may not even be conscious of it. 

Cultivating an awareness of our own psychological noise, and understanding that others bring this noise into communication, gives us an opportunity to refine our interactions.

**Finally…**

Just as experts debate how many senses we have, (yes, it’s far more than five), so communication experts may categorise types of noise slightly differently. Technical noise, (for example, a dodgy phone signal), is one such category. The key point here is that there are many small things that can impede how we understand each other.

See if you can pinpoint an instance of noise happening in your communication, then reflect, and act to mitigate the effect.
