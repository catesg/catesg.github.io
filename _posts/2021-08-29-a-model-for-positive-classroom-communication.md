In recent years we've seen developments around the idea of 'Postive Education', which is "an approach to education that blends academic learning with character and well-being. Preparing students with life skills such as: grit, optimisim, resilience, growth mindset, engagement, and mindfulness, amongst others."(Bott et al., 2017)

Positive Education fell out of developments in Positive Psychology where it was identified that focusing on the pathology, or taking a reactive approach to issues, did not necessarily lead to happy and meaningful living, rather it 'dealt with problems'. It got us from the negative to the neutral. Well-being is achieved when we move above the neutral - when we are proactive in creating our lives.

 Similarly, Positive Communication could be considered the antithesis of the so-called Dark Side of communication, and focuses on using how we interact with each other to make our lives more connected, authentic and rewarding. 

**Positive Communication (Very Briefly!)**

A key figure in promoting the idea of Positive Communication is Dr Julien Mirivel, who created and shared his Model of Positive Communication. In the 'Art of Positive Communication', Dr Julien Mirivel describes Positive Communication as: "Any verbal and nonverbal behaviours that function positively in the couse of human interaction."

His model gives us something to 'play with', to develop an understanding of how we can communicate meaningfully and richly with others.

**The Model for Positive Classroom Communication**

The Model for Positive Classroom Communication was created to support the Positive Education approach, using the fundamental ideas of Positive Communication; both of which have well-being at their core. 

Student well-being and student attainment go hand-in-hand. Happier students are more likely to do well at school - or remain in school. This can start with making the classroom a place where students are seen, heard, and understood; where teachers and students can connect, and barriers can be identified and surmounted. 

I'll write more about this model and its specific components in later posts, but for now I'll share the model for you to interpret and see what aligns with your own experience.
