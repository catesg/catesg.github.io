description: Grice's Cooperative Principle - short and simple
---
Many of us will have heard, in some form or other, the words of Sufi poet, Rumi:

>Before you speak, let your words pass through three gates
>At the first gate, ask yourself, “Is it true?”
>At the second gate ask, “Is it necessary?”
>At the third gate ask, “Is it kind?”

For me, this always brings to mind the ‘Cooperative Principle’ of British philosopher of language, Paul Grice, which states:

> “Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of talk exchange in which you are engaged.”

A bit wordy, but bear with me.

The principle is divided into four maxims, (with submaxims and supermaxims). The Gricean maxims are: quantity, quality, relevance, and manner. These four maxims support the idea that when we are communicating with someone, we want to be understood and want to understand – to cooperate to achieve effective communication. 

Here we’ll take a really quick look at the four maxims and how they are relevant to you.

<strong>Quantity (the length and depth of the content)</strong>

Simply put, say what you need to say, no more, no less. Not enough information, the listener is left none the wiser. Too much information, the message will get lost, the listener may switch off, or they will have difficulty in working out what the truly important points are.

<strong>Quality (the truthfulness of the content)</strong>

Be truthful in your words. This means not saying something you know to be false, not saying something that lacks evidence, obfuscating the truth, and lying by omission. To do so undermines your authority, your authenticity and breaks down trust.

<strong>Relation (how relevant is the content)</strong>

Oh boy, how often have you sat in a meeting, and someone has gone off on a tangent? You can feel your toes curl and your mind switch off. Riffing with your friends is one thing, as is thinking out loud to process ideas, but adding in meaningless asides and content wastes time, and important information gets lost.

<strong>Manner (how clear are you)</strong>

While quantity, quality and relation deal with the content, manner deals with the delivery of your content. The supermaxim for this is ‘Be perspicuous’. Fantastic word, though somewhat ironic, as it not a word that is clearly understood.

Avoid jargon and ambiguity [(this creates noise, as discussed in this post)](2021-08-20-what-is-communication-noise.md). Be concise and offer the information in a logical, orderly way.


<strong>In Reality</strong>

Let’s be honest, we break these maxims all the time. Going off topic, sneaking in a mistruth, throwing in a bit of jargon or being ambiguous. It happens. 

Cultural factors also affect how relevant these maxims are. We have high-context and low-context cultures. Australians, for example, tend to be direct and clear about what they want. High-context cultures, such as Japanese culture, may expect the communicators to ‘read the air’, interpret between the lines. Though this is a whole other subject...

Just know that the maxims underline the idea that when we want to communicate effectively, we need to cooperate – we work together to achieve a meaningful exchange.
