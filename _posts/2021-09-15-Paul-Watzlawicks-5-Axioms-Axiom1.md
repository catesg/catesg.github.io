Paul Watzlawick was a therapist, psychologist, philosopher and communication theorist. A pretty busy guy. He had plenty to say on many things in these fields, however we’re going to look at his theory on communication which included the Five Axioms.

These are:

<strong>Axiom 1.</strong>  One cannot not communicate.

<strong>Axiom 2.</strong>  Every communication has a content and a relationship aspect such that the latter classifies the former and is therefore a metacommunication.

<strong>Axiom 3.</strong>  The nature of a relationship is dependents on the punctuation of the partners communication procedures.

<strong>Axion 4.</strong>  Human communication involves both digital and analog modalities.

<strong>Axion 5.</strong> Inter-human communication procedures are either symmetric or complementary.

Axioms two – five require a little deciphering. Many words will not mean what you think they mean, (i.e. punctuation, analog, his use of metacommunication, etc.) The axiom I’m interested in here is the first:

><strong>One Cannot NOT Communicate</strong>

Every behaviour is a form of communication. The way we dress, hold a gaze, our gait or stance. When we walk in a room we have already communicated many things, even before saying an utterance.

For example, if we were to walk into a room then immediately leave…that will communicate something. What exactly that it, will depends not only on our expression, mannerism, demeanour – but also on the relationship we have with those in the room. Someone you have had a conflict with may interpret it as you ‘storming out’. A friend who has seen you be forgetful may assume that you’ve nipped out to get something you left behind. For as many people who witness your behaviour there will be as many possible interpretations. Messages that have been received.

**An Exercise** 

Have someone come into your classroom or workspace. Ask them to be as neutral as possible in their actions but have a clear message or thought in their mind. After 1 minute they can quietly leave.

Ask those remaining in the room “What was that about?”, “What were they doing?” “What were they saying?” Gather all the suggestions and call the ‘Neutral visitor’ back in. Let them share the thought they were focusing on. How it felt and things they noticed.

Were there any comparisons to what the others in the room thought?

The points is, when we enter a space – a meeting, a classroom, a store or enter into a conversation, we are giving of a myriad of messages from the very start. Even if we tried to be as ‘neutral’ as possible, that in itself can be interpreted as a message.

<strong>You are a communicator</strong>. You cannot NOT communicate. So, if there is no getting away from it…what messages are you going to give out?
