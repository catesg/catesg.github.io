The inaugural Virtual EI Summit was held on Clubhouse in early October this year. I was fortunate to be invited to contribute and was given the topic “What is Happening in Our Schools’. A rather broad question when you consider the global audience and not one that can be answered easily or conclusively. I elected to give a very swift and somewhat cursory look at Positive Education. The following are the notes from which I spoke. 

**Background to Positive Education**

I want to start by giving a little background to Positive Education. What is Positive Education? 

Let’s first go back a step and look at Positive Psychology, a term coined by Abraham Maslow. The term was brought into the mainstream by Dr Martin Seligman during his tenure as the president of the APA. He considered the question ‘What makes happy people are happy’ and went on to develop systematic and scientific thinking behind that. Seligman gave us the PERMA model for well-being.

The PERMA model gives us a nice starting point when we want to consider what makes us happy and taps into our development of self-awareness. (Explain key elements of model).

Positive Education sprung from the work in Positive Psychology. There was an identified discrepancy between what parents want for their children - their happiness - and what many schools offer. Traditionally schools have focused on achievement, academics and discipline. While these aspects certainly have benefits - they support certain functional needs of society - they do not necessarily lead to happiness. Positive Education draws on Positive Psychology to promote learning, self-motivation and well-being. Can we accept that academic achievement and long-term, eudemonic happiness is not a binary choice? We know, and research bears out, that happier students are more likely to attain higher.

The importance of the relationship between education and happiness is not a new idea. Thinkers as far back as Aristotle and Cicero have considered happiness to be the end goal of education, and since the early 1900s teachers have been talking about the links between happiness and academic achievement.

Now of course we have a far greater understanding of the human brain. With a higher rate of mental illness, and changing societal and individual priorities, there has been an increasing push to focus on student well-being and building personal resilience. This is what Positive Education supports.

I want to double back to Seligman for a second and the work he did with Christopher Peterson. They set about determining and understanding the key traits that comprise happier and well-rounded people. Through their research they came up with 24 Characters Strengths. Which are grouped in six key areas of virtue.

I will not go through these here, however you can find out more about this [on the Via Character org website](https://www.viacharacter.org/). There are also assessment tools on the site for you to use.

Positive Education uses these character strengths as a tool to guide and develop curricula. In fact, Martin Seligman worked with a school in Australia, the Geelong Grammar School, to create the Institute of Positive Education which is helping ‘spread the word’.  Many schools around the world are now embracing this well-being led approach to education and whilst seeing levels of academic achievement increase.

Other schools have also turned to different studies and ideas to promote student well-being. Angela Duckworth – Grit. Carole Dweck – Growth Mindset. Mihaly Csikszentmihaly – Flow. These and other work by Seligman on flourishing, authentic happiness and learned optimism, have all been picked through and used by educators, with varying degrees of success. The aim being to help students know and understand themselves, and to develop a respectful awareness of the needs of others.

Ultimately, our role as educators, or those working with children and young people, is not to simply to pour in information that can be regurgitated in an exam. It is to develop them as a whole person who can understand themselves, find their place in the world, and positively contribute to society.


**What is Happening in Reality?**

This is easier said than done. There is a myriad of challenges educators face daily and I would use up all my time if I were to start listing them all. A number can be summed up with lack of resources. Resources including time, facilities, training.

Time – For many teachers the things they are expected to impart to students seems to grow by the day. Curricula are full, so specific lessons that focus on character, self-development, and life-skills, may be the first to go when another mandatory lesson is introduced.

Facilities – This can include lack of adequate and healthy instructional space, which impacts the well-being of the students and teaching staff.

Training - Continued Professional Development may cover everything from the latest understanding in subject specific knowledge, new methodologies and pedagogy to technology training, safeguarding and so on. It is not simply a matter of scheduling an hour for teachers to learn about positive education, emotional intelligence, growth mindset, the learning pit, or whatever it is. Unless it is an institutional priority, then this often falls on a teacher’s shoulders.

Looking from a UK perspective. The national curriculum states that “all schools should make provision for personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE), drawing on good practic”’. RSE, is now a statutory requirement. CSPE (Civic, Social and Political Education) may be required or desired. 

In these areas there is a lot to thread in and depending on different schools, you will get a different presentation or mix of these. Some may focus on knife crime, bullying, drugs, or other risk-taking behaviours, and the quality and delivery can vary greatly. 

Therefore, when we want to effectively nurture character development or well-being initiatives, we are more set up to achieve quality and consistency when it is a whole-school policy that is supported by the institutional culture. 

An example. A school may look to the work of Carol Dweck and pronounce itself a ‘Growth Mindset School’. Teachers may learn in a training period ‘…something about potential…internal motivation…fixed and growth…I can’t versus I can’t yet…check out this book to find out more’. There may be a talk, a poster, an announcement that “We’re a Growth Mindset School” on the school website. Students may be told of the concept in a 15-minute form room session. However, while this looks nice in a school prospectus, this is neither necessarily focused on true cultural change or fully reflective of Dweck’s work. It is an empty bag.

We should not be too cynical here, some schools support well-being brilliantly and pursue long-term sustainable change with ongoing coaching and leadership. They interweave key concepts throughout lessons and all interactions. Sadly, others are either unaware or unable to do so – feeling pressure to prioritise academics, achievement and discipline. Because of tradition? Because choosing to change a school’s culture can seem a Herculean task? Because they don’t have the resources or support? Possibly. Probably. This is not because the schools or teachers don’t care.

Let us remind ourselves that those of us who educate want the best possible outcomes for our children. Like parents, we want them to flourish. Like parents, we don’t always get it right. One of the wonderful aspects of Positive Education is that it can affect whole school communities, as parents and teachers focus on the common goal of nurturing the whole child and recognise the importance of working in concert. 

**What can we do as parents and educators to develop EI and emotional well-being?**

Howard Gardner, in his work on multiple intelligences, talks about interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences. Some people appear to have an innate ability to reflect on their internal world and to read and relate to the emotional states of others. Others of us bear different strengths. Whatever our abilities, we can ALL benefit from more coaching and support to help develop emotionally and intelligently. Here are some simple ideas/points to think about.

Firstly – and this is the most important thing: create connection. We want to move towards a connection of mutual respect, but certainly in the first instance we want to show our young people we are there for them, we are consistent, and we are safe. 

A key to this is listening. What is the child or young person saying? Look beyond the words – read the air. Where are they spending time, what do they enjoy doing, (what are they getting out of it, what’s the ‘pay off’?). Discover what need is being met. This helps us build up an idea of who they are and where they are in their lives.

See the child as a person. They are not “our child”, as in something we need to possess and control. They are not just “a pupil or student”, part of a homogenous mass that hums down the corridors. They are distinct human beings with the same rights, feelings, hopes, fears, joys, that we share, and we need to consciously acknowledge that.

We also need to give the children the language to identify emotions. Not just small children. Teenagers and young adults also experience feeling overwhelmed. Some have never been given the language to describe their emotions.

Have you seen a toddler breakdown in a supermarket? For them it can be tiring, confusing and embarrassing. Heightened emotional states can easily escalate, therefore we want to promote a range of coping strategies to help children regulate their emotions. Some can be used in the moment, some used to build up that resilience and self-awareness. 

- Breathing techniques – a classic.
- Using their language appropriately and clearly. Give them the words or facilitate the use of non-verbal cues.
- Positive self-talk. Perhaps the child could come up with a personal mantra they can use to help them focus. 
- Mindfulness and being in their body. Lots of different methods here. Tapping, whole body writing, meditation, sport, and other physical activities.
- Promote listening skills – teach active listen.
- Teenagers can feel the same as toddlers. Empower them to make better behavioural choices within a safe space. Demonstrate trust.
- Perspective – help them put things in place and considered what they CAN do in the here and now and what the most likely impact of events. How do we stop catastrophising setbacks?
- Talk to them about the locus of control. “One of our greatest freedoms is how we react to things”.
- Look for moments to nurture empathy – cognitive, emotional and compassionate empathy. 
- Help children understand their brain – the physiology and the psychology. Older children often find it truly interesting to hear about neuroplasticity and that things are not ‘locked in’. They are free to change patterns, (again, that control).
- Create clear, reasonable and respectful boundaries, (for you and them).
- Model. What do they hear you saying to yourself? Let them see you actively use coping strategies yourself. Positive self-talk (say it out loud), practise mindfulness, etc.

We don’t have to wait for planned PSHE lessons or school assemblies. Parents don’t have to wait for a time to have a chat. In fact, little and often works best. Seize the opportunities. Use moments of transition* through the day to instigate positive coping and self-calming behaviours. Circle time, form room. Little. And. Often.

In the classroom we can use literature, drama (role play), and games to evoke and discuss emotions. Historical examples. Refer to a range of cultures and promote inclusivity in our examples and references. Make them subject specific. “Why did they?” “What would you have done?” “What do you do when…?” Step them towards identifying emotions in themselves and others and give them time to reflect on these. 

**Conclusion (moderator will lead to discussion)**

We’re going to open this room up now for discussion. There are many things I’ve talked about here, but the starting point, for both parents and educators, is simple: the relationship you create with the child. Listen and hear, foster respect and, when things are getting challenging, reset and come from a position of positive intent.


*I had discussed moments of transition in a previous group.
