description: Introduction to the StewGiff Reading Literacy and Well-being series
---
Reading has the power to transform lives. Not just the information gleaned, or the opportunities new knowledge offers us â€“ but the physical act of reading itself and effect it has on our emotions.

The next five blog posts feature a series of mini presentations, that focuses specifically on encouraging young readers.

You can <a href="/downloads/ReadingLiteracyAndWellbeing_StewGiff.pdf" target="_blank">download the Reading Literacy and Well-being handout</a> that goes along with the series. This contains a few of the key points from the presentations and space to reflect on the questions asked in the series.
