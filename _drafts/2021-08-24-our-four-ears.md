In [“What is Communication Noise?”](/2021/08/20/what-is-communication-noise.html) we looked at different types of noise that interfere with communication. One of the ways we can move past some of these barriers is to talk about how we talk to each other – or meta communication.

**Schulz von Thun and the Communication Square**

German psychologist Friedemann Schulz von Thun, now retired, is an expert in interpersonal and intrapersonal communication. He came up with a communication model; known as the ‘four-sides model’, ‘four-ears model’ or the ‘communication square’. This model shows that when we communicate with each other, (specifically with an “utterance” or unit of speech), there are four things going on at once.

1.	Content: The factual, objective information that is being given.
2.	The Appeal: This is the actual thing (desire/effect) that the sender wants.
3.	The Relationship: The connection between the sender and the receiver, how they get along, what they think of each other.
4.	Self-revelation: What the sender (or speaker) reveals about themselves. This may be conscious or not. Things such as motives, values, likes and dislikes, etc.

This means there are four possible elements that could potentially derail an interaction with someone, and we see this all the time in our daily lives.

**An Example**

I say in an exasperated tone, “There is a pile of clean clothes here that needs to be put away!”

“Ok,” responds my teenage daughter, staring at her phone. 
∏
And the clothes stay where they are.

What I Am Saying

1.	Content: There are clean clothes on the table. 
2.	The Appeal: I want my daughter to put her clean clothes away.
3.	The Relationship: We are parent and child and I expect you to do the chores I give you.
4.	Self-revelation: My tone shows I am irritated. My request suggests that I like things tidy and put away.

What My Daughter Hears

1.	Content: Yes, there are clothes on the table. 
2.	The Appeal: I’ve not been asked to do anything.
3.	The Relationship: Mum’s always nagging. My relationship with my friends is currently my priority.
4.	Self-revelation: She’s in a crabby moody today. I’m going to ignore that until it passes. 

My desire to have her move her fresh laundry to her room is not recognised, so we move into “I have asked you repeatedly…” territory.

But did I really ask her? Did I really communicate with her? I stated a fact. She acknowledged it, but the message was not clear.

**Talking About Talking**

Meta communication is when we talk about how we wish our communication to be interpreted. When we wish to be understood, we need to be cognisant of how much can be packed into a simple message. We can avoid misunderstandings by talking about how we talk.

In the example above, the descent into an “I have asked you repeatedly…” argument could be avoided if my content was clearer, so I could follow up with clarification. “When I say there is a pile of clean clothes on the table, I mean I would like you to take them to your room now, please.”

Talking about talking helps us understand ‘where the other person is coming from’. I could also acknowledge that her relationship with her friends is important. I could also perhaps tell her that I like it when she looks at me to directly acknowledge when I speak to her; a mutual acknowledgement of needs.

She may tell that it feels like I am being bossy or diminishing her when I speak in that way - or that I didn’t actually ask her to put her phone down and put the clothes away. 

While the example here is related to family life, miscommunications like this are also common in our professional lives. Sharing our expectations around how we wish to be listened and spoken to, and understanding and respecting the expectations of others, is a good first step in creating a positive and productive work environment. This model encourages us to consider the relationship, the clarity of our message and what the other person may be hearing.

Next time you find yourself at a communication impasse or recognise a misunderstanding; rather than get mired in frustration and blame, see if you can work out the ‘four-ears’ and move towards clarity and harmony.
